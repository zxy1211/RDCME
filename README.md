# RDCME

This repository is about downloading and using the Road Datasets in Complex Mountain Environments(RDCME), which will be available on Baidu Netdisk or Google Driver after the relevant paper is published.
The resolution for the remote sensing images we chose for road extraction is 0.3 m, and the images include red, green, and blue channels. To avoid corrupted parts of the images, we selected 22 HRSIs containing mountain roads from the study area. The size of image samples ranges from 1536×2048 pixels to 12288×13312 pixels. All the images are clipped into 256×256 image samples. In the final datasets, the image sample without roads was removed, containing 775 image samples.![datasets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110831276/183427943-1e309f04-407d-45b7-96e3-1d4df4339e57.png)
